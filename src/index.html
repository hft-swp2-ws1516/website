                        <p>
                            Hotcat is the result of a project carried out in scope of one of the lectures of the
                            Computer Science study programme at the <a href="http://hft-stuttgart.de/">University of Applied Sciences Stuttgart</a>. 
                            Until now, there might be two questions that have popped up in your mind:    
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                What exactly can Hotcat do for me?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Why was it named "Hotcat" in the first place? Such a weird name...
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            As these are indeed very valid questions, why don't we have a closer look? 
                            Let us start with the second one. "Hotcat" simply stands for:

                            This information also provides a hint concerning your first question: What our
                            application does is basically to scan the SSL/TLS properties of the one million most visited 
                            web sites throughout the World Wide Web according to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">alexa.com</a>.
                            The acquired results are saved in a huge database and then visualized in various graphs
                            based on the user's selections (yes, that's you!).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The following shall now give you a short overview of the functions and possibilities each menu point at the 
                            very top of this page provides you with.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Home:</b> Leads you to the page you are currently viewing. Pretty intuitive, isn't it?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Universal Summary:</b> Offers several sub points that give you the possibility to quickly and easily
                                view high-level graphs based on pre-defined selections. As the different name of the list items suggest, 
                                each graph covers a certain topic. Give it a try!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Detailed Filter:</b> In case the Universal Summary menu point doesn't suit your need 
                                for details, you should have a look at the Detailed Filter. Essentially, it provides you
                                with the possibility to search for any combination of an arbitrary cipher string, a top level 
                                domain and an SSL/TLS protocol. Besides, a built-in comparison function enables you to
                                save any number of generated graphs in order to save them for later viewing and comparing.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <b>Analyse Me:</b> If you have been wondering for the entirety of your life what the SSL/TLS properties
                                of your favorite web site are, you will probably enjoy the "Analyse Me" feature. It provides you 
                                with a text field in which you can enter the URL of that certain web site which is then scanned. Please
                                keep in mind that it might take a short while to execute the scanning process. If you need an excuse to
                                take a walk to the coffee machine, there you go!
